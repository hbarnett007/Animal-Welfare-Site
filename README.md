This site is to educate others on the number of euthanasia cases (reported) in the US and to help others reach elected officials as well as support rescues in the Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia tri-state area. 
Currently this is just a basic site, but I would like to make this more robust and help us help the dogs, rescues and families that want to do right by their furry family memebers.
